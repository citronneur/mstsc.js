## How does it works ?

### Frontend

Frontend application use socket.io and canvas for binding with mstsc.js backend. The front-end is in charge of bitmap decompression trough rle.js file. This file is generated by [**Emscripten**](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten) from [rle.c](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citronneur/mstsc.js/master/obj/rle.c) which come from rdesktop source.

### Backend

Backend application use nodejs, express and socket.io as web server. Main goal of backend is be a proxy betwwen web browser and terminal server. It use [**node-rdp**](https://github.com/citronneur/node-rdp) for rdp client.
